# Fluent Override Inspector Development Prompts

## Initial Setup and Development
**Prompt**: "Great boilerplate generate to get initial working extension"
- Created initial extension boilerplate

**Prompt**: "Took 30min to get the isolated/main context working, had to research myself how to do this"
- Set up isolated/main context communication

**Prompt**: "cloned the griffel repo to figure out what structure the debug info was"
- Researched Griffel debug info structure from the repository

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Highlight Feature Filter Support
**Prompt**: "the highlight feature should also respect the filter"
**Issue**: Highlight feature wasn't respecting the source filter
**Solution**: Updated highlight function to use the same filtering logic as scanning

### 2. Filter Order
**Prompt**: "There should be a filter to exclude too"
**Issue**: Didn't understand the need to check exclude filter before include filter
**Solution**: Reordered filter checks to exclude first, then include

### 3. Filter Communication
**Prompt**: "the filter is not being passed to the world script"
**Issue**: Filter wasn't being passed between environments correctly
**Solution**: Fixed message passing in content-isolated.js to properly forward filters

### 4. Recursive Source URL Matching
**Prompt**: "children contains recursive sourceURLs"
**Issue**: Recursive matching didn't handle cases where there was no source URL to match against
**Solution**: Refactored to first collect all source URLs, then apply filters

### 5. Empty Filters
**Prompt**: "I found a bug, when both filters are empty no griffel elements can be found"
**Issue**: When both filters were empty, no Griffel elements could be found
**Solution**: Added early return for empty filters case

### 6. Children Without Source URLs
**Prompt**: "children with no source url should not even be considered to match"
**Issue**: Children without source URLs were being considered in matching
**Solution**: Updated to only consider children that have a source URL

### 7. Exclude Filter Precision
**Prompt**: "I found a bug, when I set the exclude filter to 'GriffelCard' the following source url does not get matched 'http://localhost:5173/src/components/FluentCard.tsx:19:19'"
**Issue**: Exclude filter was matching substrings incorrectly (e.g., "GriffelCard" matching in "FluentCard")
**Solution**: Implemented more precise URL matching logic

## Current Implementation
The extension now:
1. Properly handles both include and exclude filters
2. Only considers actual source URLs in filtering
3. Correctly passes filters between environments
4. Shows appropriate status messages for filter combinations
5. Highlights elements according to filter rules
